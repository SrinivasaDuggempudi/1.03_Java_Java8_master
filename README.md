1. ### Java8 features?

**Lambda expression** - Adds functional processing capability to Java.
**Functional interfaces :** an interface that contains only a single abstract (unimplemented) method. A functional interface can contain default                             and static methods which do have an implementation, in addition to the single unimplemented method
 **Method references -** Referencing functions by their names instead of invoking them directly. Using functions as parameter.
 **Default method -** Interface to have default method implementation.
 **New tools -** New compiler tools and utilities are added like ‘jdeps’ to figure out dependencies.
 **Stream API -** New stream API to facilitate pipeline processing.
 **Date Time API -** Improved date time API.
**Optional -** Emphasis on best practices to handle null values properly.
