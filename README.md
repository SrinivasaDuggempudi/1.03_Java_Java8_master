1. ### Java8 features?

**Lambda expression** - A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are                               similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

**Functional interfaces :** an interface that contains only a single abstract (unimplemented) method. A functional interface can contain default                             and static methods which do have an implementation, in addition to the single unimplemented method.

 **Method references -** Method reference refers to the method via the use of an :: operator.
 
 **Default method -** The method which has the implementation in interface is default method. we can have any number of default methods in                             interface.
 
 **New tools -** New compiler tools and utilities are added like ‘jdeps’ to figure out dependencies.
 
 **Stream API -** New stream API to facilitate pipeline processing.
 
 **Date Time API -** Improved date time API.
 
**Optional -** Emphasis on best practices to handle null values properly.

**Nashorn, JavaScript Engine -** A Java-based engine to execute JavaScript code.
